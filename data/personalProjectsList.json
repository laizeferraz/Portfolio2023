    "ImageConclusion": "/images/projects/letmeaskRoomView.png",
    "KeyFeatures": [
      "Exclusive Q&A Rooms: Content creators can open dedicated Q&A rooms for their audience. These rooms provide a focused space for discussion and enable creators to maintain control over the session.",
      "Question Management: Once questions are posted in a room, the creator has the authority to answer, check, like, or delete them. The comment icon allows the creator to highlight the question being answered, ensuring clarity for both the creator and the audience. If a question is deemed inappropriate or irrelevant, the creator can delete it to maintain the quality of the session.",
      "Authentication and Access: Users can log in to create a room and share its code with their audience. Alternatively, users can log in and access a specific room by entering its unique code. Participation in the discussion and the ability to like questions requires user login, while anonymous users can still follow the conversation."
